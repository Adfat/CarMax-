        <p>While we can't predict the future, we can inspire it. So what will our cars look like and how will they function? Will we drive them or will they drive us? That seems to be the question on everyone's mind. Well, we have an idea. Cars are for people who want to go to more places safely and efficiently</p>

        <h1>Neue Toyota Concept Cars in Tokio</h1>
        
        <p>At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Toyota is demo’ing it’s idea of the “Future of Mobility”. As has become plainly obvious over the last couple years, Toyota believes plug-in vehicles will fail and that fuel cell EV’s are the future. While other companies are at CES showing off battery based EV’s, Toyota is sticking with their fuel cells.</p>

        <p>Its minimal yet artful interior is designed to help support its user experience. Lines flow from the center of the dashboard throughout the vehicle, while Yui travels around them, using light, sound and even touch to communicate critical information. It utilizes a single wide-screen, 3-D, full-color Head-Up Display that blends into an interior that is clean and uncluttered.</p>

However, through biometric sensors throughout the car, Concept-i can detect what you're feeling. That information then gets analyzed by the car's AI.
